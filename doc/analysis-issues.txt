* msf/test3 does never end, and needs --isolate?

## Sharphound 

Lots of detections
Too many sections
--isolate does not help?

maybe a big ass fucking signature? Let it run through once



## Mimikatz 

mimikatz.exe: normal args: Will detect two sections in .rodata
-> create mimikatz-patched.exe

mimikatz-patched.exe: 
  <none>: 
    * will detect 7 sections (all except .text)
    * bug in copying or modifying?
    * its in "Ressources", why does it trigger otherwise?
  --isolate:
    * detects .rdata
    * can't pinpoint it?!
  --remove:
    * undetected! (its in "Ressources")

  notes: 
    * removing .rdata works too
    * removing .pdata works too...
    * changing 1 byte in .reloc works (+0, +100)
    * changing 1 byte in .pdata works too (+100)

solution:
I patched with the same bytes as before ("AAAAA"...). 
Seems defender somehow realized it is malicious again!


## PetitePotatom

* <none>:
  * many, many detections - many in .code 
* --isolate:
  * no detections!

* patch:
  * in .text, .rdata, .data one byte: no difference, still detected 

solution:
Just ignore .text...
