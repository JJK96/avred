# Todo

+ MIN_LEAP = 4
  + merge adjectant matches
  + remove duplicate matches
* problems
  + if each half is detected
  + if detection is score based
  + weird detection below
+ hidesections: should not just do one after another, but ALL except one
+ patch not with " " or "\x00", but random, low entropy stuff? (base64)
+ separate tool to verify
+ fucking section names cannot be compared with "=="
+ it should also work for c# -> pe parsing is fucked 
+ make sure matches are sorted!
+ verifier
  + should use the .json to verify way better
    + once every sections 
    + one byte every section
+ show decompile stuff 
+ .net: decompile is useless, and wrong (offset)?
  + detect if its .net
  + use a .net IL decompiler  https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy
+ make radare, .net decompile optional
+ unify verifvFile in analyzer_office, analyzer_pe?
+ make all command line options a class or struct


---------------------------------------------------

* make source overview document 


* my own hexprint implemntation which takes an addr as argument
* make match.detail an object

dotnet: 
* match could cover multiple methods - handle that
* add other, more detailed references (not just .code, but the other possible sections)
* are the instructions really calculated correctly?
  * add header size too?
  * output individual instructions with offset (RVA)
* add file structure (nice layout of offsets n stuff like office)

verification: 
* make enum out of info ("one match after another"...)
flask:
* Upload with no file is hard error

general: 
* handle ctrl-c gracefully 


---------------------------------------------------
    
* other office formats
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Office_filename_extensions
  * do dotm, xlsm, xltm, pptm, potm, ppsm, sldm all work the same?
  * support for doc, xls? (not a zip)

pe:
* --isolate will isolate on identify section, but not upon scan...
* remove sections which dont start with a "."? (e.g. test.exe)

------------------------------------------------

# Handle later

? versioninfo/resources really necessary?
* automagically handle too many results in text (and other sections?)
* whats up with the small chunksize?
  * e.g. lazagne
  * add, or ignore like now? (ignoring seems to work, but why do they appear...)
