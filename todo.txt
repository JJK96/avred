+ MIN_LEAP = 4
  + merge adjectant matches
  + remove duplicate matches
* problems
  + if each half is detected
  + if detection is score based
  + weird detection below
+ hidesections: should not just do one after another, but ALL except one
+ patch not with " " or "\x00", but random, low entropy stuff? (base64)
+ separate tool to verify
+ fucking section names cannot be compared with "=="
+ it should also work for c# -> pe parsing is fucked 
+ make sure matches are sorted!

  + should use the .json to verify way better
    + once every sections 
    + one byte every section
+ show decompile stuff 

---------------------------------------------------

* Upload with no file is hard error

* .net: decompile is useless, and wrong (offset)?
  * detect if its .net
  * use a .net IL decompiler  https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy

* make radare, .net decompile optional

    
* other office formats
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Office_filename_extensions
  * do dotm, xlsm, xltm, pptm, potm, ppsm, sldm all work the same?
  * support for doc, xls? (not a zip)

* unify verifvFile in analyzer_office, analyzer_pe?
* --isolate will isolate on identify section, but not upon scan...
* handle ctrl-c gracefully 
* remove sections which dont start with a "."? (e.g. test.exe)

------------------------------------------------

# Handle later

? versioninfo/resources really necessary?
* make all command line options a class or struct
* automagically handle too many results in text (and other sections?)
* whats up with the small chunksize?
  * e.g. lazagne
  * add, or ignore like now? (ignoring seems to work, but why do they appear...)



------------------------------------------------

# Analysis results

* msf/test3 does never end, and needs --isolate?


## Mimikatz 

mimikatz.exe: normal args: Will detect two sections in .rodata
-> create mimikatz-patched.exe

mimikatz-patched.exe: 
  <none>: 
    * will detect 7 sections (all except .text)
    * bug in copying or modifying?
    * its in "Ressources", why does it trigger otherwise?
  --isolate:
    * detects .rdata
    * can't pinpoint it?!
  --remove:
    * undetected! (its in "Ressources")

  notes: 
    * removing .rdata works too
    * removing .pdata works too...
    * changing 1 byte in .reloc works (+0, +100)
    * changing 1 byte in .pdata works too (+100)

solution:
I patched with the same bytes as before ("AAAAA"...). 
Seems defender somehow realized it is malicious again!


## PetitePotatom

* <none>:
  * many, many detections - many in .code 
* --isolate:
  * no detections!

* patch:
  * in .text, .rdata, .data one byte: no difference, still detected 

solution:
Just ignore .text...
